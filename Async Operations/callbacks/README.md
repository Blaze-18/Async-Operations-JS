# Callback Examples in JavaScript

This repository contains examples of using callbacks in JavaScript, ranging from basic to advanced concepts. Each file demonstrates a specific use case of callbacks, culminating in a practical implementation using a cat fact API.

## Files

1. **`01-basic-callback.js`**: Basic example of a callback function.
2. **`02-error-handling.js`**: Demonstrates error handling in callbacks.
3. **`03-callback-chaining.js`**: Shows how to chain multiple callbacks.
4. **`04-fetchData-sim.js`**: Simulates fetching data asynchronously.
5. **`05-event-handling.js`**: Demonstrates event handling with callbacks.
6. **`06-practical-cat-fact-exercise.js`**: Practical implementation using a cat fact API.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open each file in a code editor or run them in a browser/Node.js environment.
3. Experiment with the code and modify it to understand how callbacks work.
