    This is a static web page that fetches data from the Cat Fact API and demonstrates the use of callbacks in 
    JavaScript to handle asynchronous operations, such as fetching data and responding to user interactions like 
    "Like" and "Dislike" buttons. It also includes a collection of basic callback examples to help learners understand 
    the fundamentals of callbacks in JavaScript.
